Optimizing Solar Tracking using AI

The main purpose of this project is to fundamentally design a solar tracking system to improve the efficiency of the solar panel systems that may have solar tracking capabilities. This study demonstrates how we can fundamentally improve the accuracy of our solar tracking capabiities while observing the charactersistics of different AI NN types.

Observed AI NN Types:

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)
Possible AI NN Types:

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Generative Averserial Networks (GAN)
Radial Basis Function (RBF)
Boltzaman Machine (BM)
Modular Neural Network (Mod-NN)
